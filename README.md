Lesson 1: Motivation

A single LLM can do a lot, but it’s limited — it can’t use tools, remember context, or handle multi-step tasks on its own.
LangGraph fixes this by letting us connect different steps (like retrieving data, reasoning, summarizing) into one flow.
It basically turns isolated LLM calls into structured, stateful workflows that can reason and act more intelligently.

Lesson 2: Simple Graph

In this lesson, I learned how to create a simple graph using LangGraph. The main idea is to connect different nodes (agents or tasks) and define how data flows between them. I got hands-on experience setting up inputs and outputs, running the graph, and seeing how everything interacts.

It also touched on debugging and monitoring the graph, which helps make sure everything works as expected. Overall, this lesson gave me a solid foundation to build more complex agent workflows in the future.
